# PowerOn

A macOS application to schedule wake-up and shutdown times.

## Features

*   View the current `pmset` schedule.
*   Set a new schedule for wake-up, and shutdown.
*   Built with SwiftUI.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly macOS application that provides a graphical interface for the `pmset` command-line utility. This will allow users to easily schedule their Mac to wake up or shut down at specific times without using the terminal.
